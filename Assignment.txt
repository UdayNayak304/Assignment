1) Difference between SDLC (Software Deveploment Life Cycle) and STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle).
 
A) -> Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a sequence of different activities performed during the software development process.
    1. SDLC is mainly related to software development.
    2. Besides development other phases like testing is also included.
    3. SDLC involves total six phases or steps.
          1.Requirement Analysis
          2.Software Design   
          3.Software Build
          4.Testing
    	  5.Deployment
          6.Maintenance
     4.In SDLC, more number of members (developers) are required for the whole process.
     5.In SDLC, development team makes the plans and designs based on the requirements.

   -> Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a sequence of different activities performed during the software testing process.
     1. STLC is mainly related to software testing.
     2. It focuses only on testing the software.
     3. STLC involves only five phases or steps.
           1. Test Planning
           2. Test Case Development
           3. Test Environment Steup
           4. Test Exicution
           5. Test Closure
     4.In STLC, less number of members (testers) are needed.
     5.In STLC, testing team(Test Lead or Test Architect) makes the plans and designs.

2) Verfication and Validation 

A) -> Verfication:- 
       
     1. Verification is a process of checking documents, design, code, and program in order to check if the software has been built 
        according to the requirements or not. 
     2. The main goal of verification process is to ensure quality of software application, design, architecture etc. 
     3. The verification process involves activities like reviews, walk-throughs and inspection.
     4. Verification checks whether the software confirms a specification.
     5. Verification finds the bugs early in the development cycle.
     6. It comes before validation.
   
   -> Validation:-  
     
     1. Validation is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not.
     2. The process helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment.
     3. The validation process involves activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.
     4. Validation checks whether the software meets the requirements and expectations.
     5. Validation finds the bugs that verification can not catch.
     6. It comes after Verfication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Authorization and Authentication
 
A) -> Authorization:-
    
     1. Authorization is the process of granting someone to do something. 
     2. It means it a way to check if the user has permission to use a resource or not.
     3. It defines that what data and information one user can access.
     4. The authorization usually works with authentication so that the system could know who is accessing the information.
     5. It requires the user's privilege or security level.
     6. It is usually done once the user is successfully authenticated.

   -> Authentication
     
     1. Authentication is the process of identifying someone's identity by assuring that the person is the same as what he is claiming for.
     2. It is used by both server and client. The server uses authentication 
        when someone wants to access the information and the server needs to know who is accessing the information 
        the client uses it when he wants to know that it is the same server that it claims to be.
     3. The authentication by the server is done mostly by using the username and password 
        Other ways of authentication by the server can also be done using cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.
     4. Authentication does not ensure what tasks under a process one person can do
        what files he can view read or update. It mostly identifies who the person or system is actually.
     5. Data is provided through the Token Ids.
     6. Authentication credentials can be partially changed by the user as per the requirement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Test Management Review 

A) -> A management review is an important aspect of a management system that 
      demonstrates commitment from the organization for implementing, reviewing, 
      and continually improving the management system and associated processes and documents. 
    The management review acts as:
     1. A formal review of the system status and progress towards the objectives.
     2. A method to change the system as the company’s needs change.
     3. Gives clear concept of understanding of testing activity of prior upcoming project and also post ones
   Test Management has five process
     1. Test plan
     2. Test Design
     3. Test excution
     4. Exit Criteria
     5. Test Reporting
  Tools Commenly used in Test management 
     1. qTest
     2. Zephyr
     3. Test Collab
     4. XQual
     5. TestRail
     6. TestPad.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Client Side and Server Side Validation.
 
A) -> Validation
     
    1. Validation is a process of testing and ensuring that the user has entered required and properly formatted information through the web form.
    2. Validation rules not only ensure that incoming data is valid, but they also provide an additional layer of security.
    3.You can configure validation to occur either client side (if the data is being entered by a user) or server side (if the data is coming from an external system).

  -> Client Side Validation
     
    1. Client-side validation occurs as a user is entering data into a browser.
    2. If a user enters data that is invalid or outside acceptable ranges, an error is raised that can be acted upon before the data enters the system. 
    3. In client-side validation, all the input validations and the error recovery process are carried out on the user’s browser. The browser performs the validation. 
    4. Client-side validation is triggered based on the event attached to validationtype.
   
  -> Server Side Validation
    
    1. Server-side validation occurs when data has entered the system from any external source and cannot be validated beforehand.
    2. In this case when invalid data is detected by a validation rule an error is raised that marks the data as invalid.
    3. This can be detected and acted upon by other rule types to correct or notify someone about the error. 
    4. In server-side validation, all the input validations and error recovery process are carried out on the server side.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) Request Respons flow from front end to back end. 

A) -> 1. The backend and frontend both work together to serve a single goal. 
         It’s pretty helpful to keep it in mind at all times. They are made, so a user can access them
      2. The frontend and backend make this possible by causing requests to be sent and answering with responses.
          1. Server
          2. Backend 
          3. Frontend
          4. Browser

            Browser-------->Frontend
              | |
              | |
      Request | | Response
              | |
              V V
            Server---------->Backend

      1. The user points their browser to one of website’s urls 
         This makes the browser send out one or more requests to server
         The browser waits to receive responses from server
         Every response is used to render a part of the site

      2. The user waits for the browser to render the page.
      3. The user sees a useful and usable page
      4. The user interacts with the page
         Causing more requests to be sent out to get more data and display new information and so on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) Life Cycle Phases of project 

A) -> There are 5 Phases of life cycle of project 
         1.Initiation
         2.Planning  
         3.Execution
         4.Monitoring and Controlling
         5.Clouser 

     1. Initiation 
          This is the starting point of the project. The project gets conceptualized in this phase.
                     In this stage, the following steps are implemented
 
         1.The project idea is either created or the client approaches the idea.
           The idea can be the solution to an existing problem or a new opportunity in business (e.g., new smartphone model launch).  
         2.A business case document is created providing the solution to implement the idea after the
           brainstorming sessions consisting of the team, client, and project managers.
         3.Project managers and concerned teams check the feasibility of implementing the project in terms of profits, cost, timeline, resources, etc.
         4.Once the project has passed this feasibility test, it is proposed for approval from the leadership team of the company/business unit.
         5.During approval, SOW for the project is signed, and the budget is allocated.

   After the successful completion of the above steps, the project is moved to the planning phase.

      2.Planning Phase.
            This is the second phase of project management. During this phase, a detailed project plan is created.
            This plan includes tasks, resources required, timelines, cost, etc. In addition, further planning for prioritizing requirements is done.
       
          Different plans that are created depending on the type of project are:
                     1. Communication Plan
                     2. Resource Plan
                     3. Quality Plan
                     4. Deployment Plan

       3. Execution Phase. 
            Done with the project idea finalization and planning. Now it’s time to set to work. 
            In this phase, previous planning is put into action. This phase depends highly on planning. Better the plan better will be the execution.
         
          below steps are used in this process:
                 1. Resource allocation and ensuring its timely delivery.
                 2. Assigning the tasks to team members on a daily basis.
                 3. Taking daily meetings.
                 4. Creating a status report based on daily meetings and the progress of the project.
           Here the entire team comes to the picture as it starts with actual work

       4. Monitoring and controlling
               This phase is merged with the execution phase because both occur at the same time. 
               The main objective here is to ensure that execution is carried out as per the plan. Timelines and costs adhere.
         Below points are implemented during monitoring:
                 1. Set the key performance indicators (KPI’s).
                 2. Compare the progress plan or status report with the project plan to measure KPI’s.
                 3. For any deviation from the project, reduce the deviation and redefine KPI’s.
                 4. Update the plan for any changes to meet the deadline.
                 5. Monitor budget utilization.
                 6. Monitor the quality of the project.

        5. Clouser Phase
               Now that project is completed, and it is time to deploy the project to the client or launch in the market.
               This is where the collaborated efforts come to a fruitful end. A deployment plan created in the planning phase comes into action.
                 The closure phase has:
                   1. Releasing the deliverables(product/service) to the stakeholders.
                   2. Communicating the closure to stakeholders and business partners.
                   3. Signing off business documents.
                   4. Releasing the team members and closing the contracts.
                   5. Payment and documentation filing.
                   6. Documenting lessons learned and best practices adopted during the project so that it can be used for future reference for other projects.
                   7. Setting up support and maintenance structure as per the requirement.

      -> So above are the Project Life cycle Phases. Where these phases aren't mutually exclusive they may overlap in practice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   
8) Success
  
   -> Success every one wants it but only few work for it and full fill its demands. Where success demands.
              1. Hard Work 
              2. Consistany
              3. Patience
              4. Persistance.                 
      In the Path of Life success has only camma's not Full stop's.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9) Strengths and Weakness
      
    -> I always work with discipline where i belive discipline takes to places where motivation can't
    -> I can't say no to any one when ask's me for help.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10) -> After Completion of my Graduation i went to delhi where i dont know any one i dont have any relative and i strugled a lot for living and i dont know how do i 
       survived in delhi where new place and new people and the language. I over came all the situation with my strong will and active mind. It was very tough to
       survive in northern part of india i was all alone. But it gave a belife that i can survive and over come any kind of situation in my life. Being alone made
       me strong think about my future and work on it. This is the challenging situation that i faced in my life.
